Android native video player written in Kotlin. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to play videos on their Android devices.
ExoPlayer is an open-source media player library for Android developed by Google. ExoPlayer is designed to be flexible and extensible, with support for a wide variety of audio and video formats, as well as advanced playback features such as adaptive streaming, seamless looping, and dynamic bitrates. It also provides a simple API for controlling playback and monitoring playback events, making it easy to integrate into your Android application.

ExoPlayer is also highly customizable, with support for custom renderers, audio and video codecs, and track selection strategies. This allows developers to tailor the player to their specific needs and optimize playback performance for their particular use case.

It can show videos in folders as well as without folders in a separate section. It provides the best equalizer for managing audio track frequencies.
